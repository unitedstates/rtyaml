# This class is a helper that facilitates editing YAML files

#
# with rtyaml.edit("path/to/data.yaml", default={}) as data:
#   data["hello"] = "world"
#
# The file is opened for editing ("r+ mode"), read, and its
# parsed YAML data returned as the with-block variable (`data`
# in this case). The file is kept open while the with-block
# is executing. When the with-block exits the stream is overwritten
# with the new YAML data, and the file is closed.
#
# This will of course only work if the file contains an array
# or object (dict), and you cannot assign a new value to the
# with-block variable --- you can only call its methods, e.g.
# you can edit the list and dict, but you can't replace the
# value with an entirely new list or dict.
#
# If the default parameter is not given, or is None, the file
# must exist. Otherwise, if the file doesn't exist, it's created
# and the with-block variable holds the default value.
#
# You can also pass a stream as the first argument if you want
# to open the file yourself. The stream must support seek, truncate,
# and close.
